The aim of this application is to enable the user to upload a csv of transactions.

I chose to use Symfony to enable me to easily adhere to the MVC pattern. It also
enabled easy View templating and formatting. It has built in Entity creation,
which can be changed easily to not access a database. There is a built in server
to enable easy development, instead of running up a web server.

Using Symfony meant a whole lot of boiler plate code did not need to be written 
as well, as that is contained in the framework. This reduces development time.


Installation and running:
Extract or git clone the files onto a system with php7+.

cd padua-csv or bank
symfony server:start
